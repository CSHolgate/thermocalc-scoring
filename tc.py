    My goal is to somehow accept an argument from shell (command line) that looks
    and functions like a dictionary. Not sure how to do that now, but I will move forward
    assuming that it is possible. 

    INPUTS:
      - The global composition (given as a dictionary with the element as the key and
        the concentration as the value). This global composition represents the 
        mixed composition of the BCC and the B2 predicted by the language model
        and also captures the relative proportion of each.

    For outputs, I am envisioning this class wrapping a few different functions each with their own output.
    Functions and outputs:
      - Thermo-Calc: This will output a table in long-form with the calculation results.
      - Thermo-Calc Confidence Score: This will output some number(s) that detail how much faith
                                      we should put into the Thermo-Calc results
      - Reward function: This would reference the TC results and the confidence score to assign some
                         reward to the model.

        Neal: This would be the place I think to build in some confidence score as a result
        of the assessed ternaries. One thought is to take some function like:

        confidence_score = frac_critically_assessed + 0.5 * frac_tentatively_assessed

        This would effectively count tentatively assessed systems less. A completely unassessed system
        would receive a score of 0, whereas a perfect system would get 1.

        An issues with this approach:
        We will probably run into cases (like Nb-Ti-Ru) where there is no assessed ternaries.
        This would receive a score of 0. But so would something like (Nb-Ti-Ru-Y). But in the
        first case there would only be one missing ternary, whereas in the second there is four
        missing ternaries. This may mean that we would want to add in negative score for missed
        ternaries. But this would require the scoring metric to be able to handle negative values.
        Neal and I talked about this issue for a bit, but I think we need to think about this some
        more. A negative score could be implemented as:

        confidence_score = frac_critically_assessed + 0.5 * frac_tent_assessed - frac_not_assessed

        Then the score would be bounded by -1 to 1. The key point here (I think) would be what prefactor
        do tentatively assessed systems get?
