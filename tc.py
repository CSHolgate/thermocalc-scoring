    My goal is to somehow accept an argument from shell (command line) that looks
    and functions like a dictionary. Not sure how to do that now, but I will move forward
    assuming that it is possible. 

    INPUTS:
      - The global composition (given as a dictionary with the element as the key and
        the concentration as the value). This global composition represents the 
        mixed composition of the BCC and the B2 predicted by the language model
        and also captures the relative proportion of each.

    For outputs, I am envisioning this class wrapping a few different functions each with their own output.
    Functions and outputs:
      - Thermo-Calc: This will output a table in long-form with the calculation results.
      - Thermo-Calc Confidence Score: This will output some number(s) that detail how much faith
                                      we should put into the Thermo-Calc results
      - Reward function: This would reference the TC results and the confidence score to assign some
                         reward to the model.

        Neal: We should talk more (probably with Sam and Satanu) about how to do
        this scoring.

        The key issue is that we will probably run into cases (like Nb-Ti-Ru)
        where there are no assessed ternaries in the database. A simple approach
        of just counting the positive hits, weighing the tentatively assessed
        systems worse, like:
        
        confidence_score = frac_critically_assessed + 0.5 * frac_tentatively_assessed
        
        would assign a score of 0. A perfect system would get 1. This sounds
        good, but consider something like (Nb-Ti-Ru-Y). This system has four
        ternaries and all are unassessed. So in the previous case there is one
        missing ternary but here there are four. With the above equation both
        would receive the same score (of 0) which doesn't feel right. There is a
        lot more extrapolation happening for the case with four missing
        ternaries.
         
        This may mean that we would want to add in a **not normalized** negative
        score for missed ternaries. But this would require the scoring metric to
        be able to handle (potentially arbitrary) negative values. And
        realistically, given how incomplete the databases are, I suspect it
        would make most of the scores negative. Another option is to just go
        unbounded in the score, but I would guess that would also cause issues.
        Anyway, this now obnoxiously long comment will serve as a marker for
        discussion!
